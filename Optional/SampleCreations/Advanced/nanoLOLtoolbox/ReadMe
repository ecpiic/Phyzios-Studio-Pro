~~~~~~~~~~~What is the nanoLOLtoolbox?~~~~~~~~~~

This is a collection of files that contain original 
designs for mechanical logic gates in Phyzios. 

They have been built on the principles of nanomachines,
creations built using the absolute fewest number of 
particles possible. This keeps FPS as high as possible
while producing extremely compact results.

Link-Only-Logic (LOL) has several attractive benefits
for the construction of mechanical calculators in
Phyzios. By using only the most primitive and simple
interactions, we can produce the fastest, lightest, 
and least computationally complex machines possible,
contributing to high FPS performance. By using only
Rigid and Links, all of the other elements are free
to be configured in various other ways. In addition, 
Links permit the geometry of components to overlap
allowing more compact designs. As Links always have 
constant behavior, there is little to no concern that 
these devices will function differently over a wide 
variety of Parameter configurations, allowing the 
integration of mechanical logic into a wide array of
experiments.
