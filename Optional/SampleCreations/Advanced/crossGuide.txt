How-To:

This device provides a visual reference point, typically for precisely aligning particles. 

-The central cross can be used to align two particles on precisely the same spot, among other things. 
-The 90 degree cross for example can precisely pinpoint where to place a new particle in a grid, 
  well away from others by lining up with reference particles. 
-With practice it can be used to find the center of a circle to make an axle.

Usage:
-The structure is Wall+Rigid so grabbing one particle with the Select tool will grab the whole structure
-Aligning things is never a perfect process, but the higher the Zoom level the closer particles can be placed. 
  All edits that need precision should be done at maximum Particle Size in the Property window which is 64. 
  The central Handle particle is for moving the guide at high zoom levels

-The guide has two modes: temporary and permanent
-Temporary:
  With the game paused, selecting the particles will allow you to use it as long as the game is pausod. 
  When the game is unpaused it will return to it's original position. This is useful for saving a reference point. 
-Permanent:
  With the game paused, reposition the guide. Use the Spuit tool to select it's material. 
  Use the Replace tool on it to permanently reposition the guide. It will remain there when the game is unpaused.

-Angle:
-The angle of the guide can be set by giving the structure a module 
-First open the Browser window with Ctrl+7 or Window -> Browser
  Use the Select tool to highlight one of the guide particles. This will automatically highlight it in the Browser.
  Create a module for it. The Angle value is set in radians
  r  = 3.141592654
  r/2= 90deg
  1r = 180deg
 -r/2= 270deg/-90deg
  2r = 360deg

  Angles in degress can be set with this formula:
  3.141592654*(deg/180)
